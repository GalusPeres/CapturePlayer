## Why I built CapturePlayer

Setting up OBS or similar tools just to display and stream a capture card to Discord was always a hassle for me. I was tired of fighting with complex menus, wrong aspect ratios, and desynchronized audio.

That's why I built **CapturePlayer**:  
A simple, modern app that instantly shows your capture card’s video and audio with one click.  
No complicated setup, no overlays, no advanced configs — just your image and sound, always in sync.

## Key Features

- **Instant Preview:** One click, and your capture card signal is shown in a window.
- **Auto Aspect Ratio:** The correct format is detected and set automatically.
- **Synchronized Audio:** No more lag between video and sound.
- **Pin to Top:** Keep the window always visible, even while multitasking.
- **Customizable Colors:** Adjust the UI for your personal style.
- **Modern, minimal look:** Built with Electron, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
