# CapturePlayer

A minimalist capture card viewer for PC gaming and Discord streaming. Built for Nintendo Switch and other consoles.

## The Problem

When you want to play Nintendo Switch games on your PC monitor through a capture card and stream it on Discord, OBS is unnecessarily complicated:
- You need to configure audio routing
- Set up the preview projector to show only the video
- Deal with UI elements you don't need
- Navigate through complex menus just to view your console

- Video adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation, hue)

### Simple Configuration
- Quick device switching in settings
- No complex setup required
- Works immediately after connecting your capture card
